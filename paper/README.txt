This is the README file for the LaTeX Article Template for Royal Society of Chemistry Journals.

The zip file contains:

 - rsc-articletemplate.tex (the template with example text)

 - rsc-articletemplate.pdf (an example of the template output PDF)

 - rsc.bib (example bibliography)

 - example1.pdf and example2.pdf (example figures)

 - head_foot (folder containing header and footer images)

 - rsc.bst (the RSC bibliography style file).


The following files need to be in the same folder as rsc-articletemplate.tex for the example template to compile correctly:

 - head_foot

 - example1.pdf

 - example2.pdf

 - rsc.bib

 - rsc.bst.
